The goal of ediblecity is to is to estimate the potential of UA to
contribute to addressing several urban challenges at the city-scale.
Within this aim, we followed the urban challenges defined by the Eklipse
project that are followed for nearly all of the European projects
focused on Nature-based Solutions. We selected 8 indicators directly
related to one or several urban challenges.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ediblecity from
[r-universe](https://r-universe.dev) with:

``` r
install.packages("ediblecity", repos = "jospueyo.r-universe.dev")
```

## Indicators estimated

The package provides eight indicators that estimate different benefits
of urban agriculture:

- `food_production()`: Amount of food produced in the city.
- `green_capita()`: Green per capita can be computed as raw or as the
  difference among neighbourhoods.
- `green_distance()`: Distance to closest public green area larger than
  certain surface. It computes also the proportion of homes that are
  further than a specific threshold.
- `UHI()`: Urban heat island as a rasters (`stars` object) or as numeric
  values.
- `edible_jobs()`: Number of jobs created by commercial urban
  agriculture.
- `edible_volunteers()`: Number of volunteers involved in community
  urban agriculture.
- `no2_seq()`: Amount of NO<sub>2</sub> sequestered by urban green (in
  gr/s).
- `runoff_prev()`: Runoff in the city after a specific rain event. It
  also computes the amount of rainwater harvested by urban agriculture
  initiatives.

## Set a scenario

Although `ediblecity` can also estimate indicators directly from an `sf`
object, the function `set_scenario` provides a basic tool to create an
scenario combining different proportions of elements of urban
agriculture. Some warnings are triggered when the function can’t satisfy
the parameters passed by the user.

``` r
library(ediblecity)

scenario <- set_scenario(city_example,
                         pGardens = 0.7,
                         pVacant = 0.8,
                         pRooftop = 0.6,
                         pCommercial = 0.5)
#> Only 328 rooftops out of 362.4 assumed satisfy the 'min_area_rooftop'
```

All attributes of urban agriculture elements are included in
`city_land_uses` dataframe. This can be used as default. Otherwise, a
customized dataframe can be provided to compute each indicator.

``` r

knitr::kable(city_land_uses)
```

improved as well as new indicators can be created. Likewise, the
creation of new scenarios can include new elements of urban agriculture
or provide further customization.
