#' @title The number of volunteers involved in urban agriculture in your city
#' @description This indicator estimates the number of volunteers potentially involved in community urban agriculture
#' initiatives in your city. It uses a range of volunteers per square meter to create the median and the
#' confidence interval of the number of volunteers by simulating a random uniform distribution of 1000 values
#' within the provided range. The default range came from required work hours in urban agriculture assessed
#' in scientific literature, assuming that a volunteers dedicates a 10% of a full-time job.
#' @author Josep Pueyo-Ros
#' @param x An 'sf' object with the urban model of your city and a 'Function' column with categories of urban features.
#' @param volunteers A vector of length 2 with the range of volunteers involved by square meter of edible gardens.
#' @param edible The categories in 'Functions' that represent community edible gardens. If NULL, functions
#' from 'city_functions' dataset area used where volunteers is TRUE.
#' @param area_col The column to be used as the area of each feature. If NULL, the area is calculated with
#' sf::st_area().
#' @param interval A numeric value with the confidence interval returned by the function.
#' @param verbose If TRUE, the indicators returns a vector (N=1000) with all simulated values.
#' @return If verbose is FALSE, it returns a named vector with the median and the low and high confidence intervals.
#' Otherwise, it returns a vector of length 1000 with all simulated values.
