Description: The purpose of ediblecity is to estimate the potential of UA to contribute to addressing several urban challenges at the city-scale. Within this aim, we followed the urban challenges defined by the Eklipse project that are followed for nearly all of the European projects focused on Nature-based Solutions. We selected 8 indicators directly related to one or several urban challenges.
