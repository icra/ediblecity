Description: The purpose of this package is to estimate the potential of urban agriculture to contribute to addressing several urban challenges at the city-scale. Within this aim, we selected 8 indicators directly related to one or several urban challenges. Also, a function is provided to compute new scenarios of urban agriculture. Methods are described by Pueyo-Ros, Comas & Corominas (2023) <doi:10.12688/openreseurope.16054.1>.
