\title{Distance to closest public green area}
\usage{
green_distance(
  x,
  green_cat = NULL,
  min_area = 5000,
  residence_col = "Function_verbose",
  residences = "Residence",
  percent_out = FALSE,
  max_dist = 300,
  verbose = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An 'sf' object with the urban model of your city and a 'Function' column with categories of urban features.}

\item{green_cat}{A vector with the categories in 'Function' that must be considered in the calculations. If
NULL (default), the 'city_functions' dataset is used where 'public' is TRUE.}

\item{min_area}{A numerical value (in meters). smaller green areas are not considered in the calculations.}

\item{residence_col}{The column 'x' where the residences are specified.}

\item{residences}{A vector with the categories that represent residences.}

\item{percent_out}{If TRUE, the function returns the percentage of residences further than 'max_dist'.
(default = FALSE)}

\item{max_dist}{A numeric value representing the maximum distance that a residence should be from a
public green area.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE returns the vector of distances. Otherwise, it returns as specified in value section.}
}
\value{
If 'percent_out' is FALSE, it returns a summary of statistics for distance. Otherwise, it
returns a numeric value with the percentage of residences further than 'max_dist' from its closest
public green area.
}
\description{
This indicator calculates the distance from each residence to its closest public green area
larger than 'min_area'. It can return the summary of distances or the percentage of residence buildings further
than a defined distance.
